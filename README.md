# My Portfolio Site

Welcome to my Portfolio site! I am a Sr. Manager of Software Engineering at Capital One and a student of the University of Richmond's Full-Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp. 

## Description

This site is my first publicly accessible project. I created it to inform viewers some basic information about me, where to submit their contact information, and links to other projects I contributed to. While building this site I leveraged html, css, and javascript. This project taught me how to create a responsive website that is accessible to all device sizes and to leverage [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) a CSS framework to style my pages consistently.
