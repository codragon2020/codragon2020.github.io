                <p>I was born and raised in Glen Allen, VA, where I spent most of my youth playing sports. I had an early love for baseball with a talent for speed and hand-eye coordination. Throughout school, I participated in wrestling, football, baseball, track & field, as well as Cross Country. My parents were incredibly supportive throughtout it all.</p>
                <p>I discovered martial arts later in life. <a href="https://competitiveedgekarate.com/" target="_blank">Karate and Kickboxing</a> was a gateway for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wujidomartialarts/about" target="_blank">Shoa-lin KungFu</a>. I would say I have a healthy obsession with Kungfu. I have also enjoyed training in <a href="https://www.cuongnhu.com/" target="_blank">Cuong Nhu</a>, a non-traditional Vietnamese Martial Art. Due to the pandemic, nowadays, I enjoy exercising through running and dreaming of a day when I can get back to my training.</p>
                <p>Having received an excellent business education with CIS concentration from <a href="http://www.longwood.edu/business/business-administration/#InformationSystemsandCyberSecurityISCS" target="_blank">Longwood University</a>, I decided to continue my studies at <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/cob/mba/infosec/index.shtml" target="_blank">James Madison University</a> as a graduate student. There I pursued my MBA in Information Security. This is where I discovered a passion for technology and the field of Information Security.</p>
                <p>I kick started my career in the Tech industry while I was living in Miami, FL. This System Admin role was my first satisfying IT job. From there I moved to Dallas, TX and became a System Consultant for a small firm out of Addison. This role gave me an overview of IT that paved the way for years to come. Like full circle, my life brought me back the the Richmond area, where I began my journey at <a href="https://www.capitalonecareers.com/" target="_blank">Capital One</a>.
                <p>While at Capital One I have gained expertise in many interesting technologies utilized in and around the Financial and Tech Industries. Nothing is cooler than <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a>! I am new to Software Engineering, but my desire to learn, coupled with a strong passion for technology has me very excited for the future! </p>
                <p>Having held many tech roles, I find software engineering to be the most intriguing challenge yet. There is no doubt software is changing the world. The global embrace of technology has far more potential than anyone can imagine. While I am determined to support it, I also want to lead the change. Gandhi once said "Be the change you wish to see in the world". As I remain true to my purpose, I recognize my desire to make the change happen rather than allow the change to happen to me.</p>
