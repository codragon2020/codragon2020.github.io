                <p>I was born and raised in Glen Allen, VA. As a youth, sports was my life. I started ealier trying Karate, Soccer, and Baseball. Baseball stuck with me as I had a talent for speed and hand-eye coordination. Throughout middle and high school, I participated in wrestling, football, baseball, track&field and also Cross Country (I think that's all...). Looking back, it sure does seem like a lot.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, I enjoy exercising through running and martial arts. I was obsessed with Shoalin KungFu for a while, which I hope to someday get back to.</p>
                <p>As a young adult, I received an excellent business education with CIS concentration from Longwood University. I proceeded to graduate school to pursue my MBA in Information Security. This is where I discovered a passion for technology and the field of Information Security.</p>
                <p>I kick started my career in the Tech industry while I was living in Miami, FL. This System Admin role was my first satisfying IT job. From there I moved to Dallas, TX and became a System Consultant for a small firm out of Addison. This role gave me an overview of IT that paved the way for years to come. Like full circle, my life brought me back the the Richmond area, where I began my journey at Capital One.
                <p>While at Capital One I have gained expertise in many interesting technologies utilized in and around the Financial and Tech Industries. Nothing is cooler than AWS! I am new to Software Engineering, but my desire to learn, coupled with a strong passion for technology has me very excited for the future! </p>
